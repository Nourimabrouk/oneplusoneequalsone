Unity Visualization Access:
1. The visualization is now saved as 'unity_visualization.html' in your working directory
2. Open this file in your web browser to interact with the 3D visualization
3. In RStudio, the visualization should appear in the Viewer pane
4. Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and explore the unity patterns
